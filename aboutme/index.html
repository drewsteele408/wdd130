    <h2>Drew Steele</h2>
    <p>My name is Drew Steele and I have lived for 22 years. It has been great so far. 
    I like to snowboard and skateboard and things like that. 
    <p>I got married last July
    which was super awesome. Right now I am a computer science major but I am not sure 
    what I am wanting to do for a career just yet.</p> 
    I am really excited for this class 
    and to learn how to create websites. So far it has been really fun. </p>
    <p>I also like like rice cripsy treats. </p>
